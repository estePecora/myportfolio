                    <p>I’m a responsible and proactive person, 
                        I enjoy helping others and I’m always willing to learn and develop new skills.
                        I’ve worked in advertising for several years, but I’ve always been interested in technology,
                        and how it improves people's lives.
                        When I started learning to code I realized it combined two of my favorite things: technology and creative thinking, 
                        so I decided to change the course of my professional path. If you like my profile leave me a message!
